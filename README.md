# **Overdrive**

*Why play at 20 TPS when you can play at 200?!?*

## **What is this?**
**Overdrive** allows you to permanently(*until you restart, reload, or crash your server*) increase or decrease your maximum tps. You can speed it up as high as your cpu can handle, or lower it down to **1 TPS**. Note that many features of Minecraft may no longer perform as expected, and will look strange on the client's end. Many plugins that depend on accurate system time may break or function incorrectly when the TPS is changed. This plugin is not responsible for any damage that may occur, or mental trauma from switching off of *easy mode*. **THIS PLUGIN IS NOT FOR** ***CASUALS***

## **Cool, how do I stop playing on *easy mode*?**
Simple, increase the TPS with the command `/overdrive 200`. This will increase your maximum TPS to 200, or as high as your server can handle. Note that `/tps` doesn't show you your real TPS if it goes above 20. You will have to use timings for that.

### Commands
- `/overdrive [TPS]` - Change the current tps, or view the new one

### Permissions
- `overdrive.lunatic` - You'd have to be a lunatic to have this permission
